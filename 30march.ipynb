    "#1 Elastic Net Regression is a statistical technique that combines the penalties from both the lasso and ridge regression methods to improve the regularization of statistical models.012 It overcomes the limitations of the LASSO method, which uses a penalty function based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator.0 The elastic net method combines the L1 and L2 penalties of the lasso and ridge methods to deal with multicollinearity issues when they arise between predictor variables. Regularization aids in solving the overfitting issues with the models. The primary idea underlying the elastic net is regularization, which is considered in situations where the model is overfitting."

With elastic net, you don't have to choose between these two models, because elastic net uses both the L2 and the L1 penalty! In practice, you will almost always want to use elastic net over ridge or lasso, and in this article you will learn everything you need to know to do so, successfully!"

It also exhibits strict convex edges where the convexity depends on the value of α.Convexity is also dependent on the grouping effect dependent on the correlation of the variables selected.

    "#7 Elastic Net Regression is a popular technique for feature selection and regularization in quantitative analytics. It combines the advantages of ridge and lasso regression, which penalize the coefficients of the linear model based on their magnitude and sparsity, respectively.1 Elastic Net Regression can perform feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant variables to zero, resulting in a model with fewer variables, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting. The L1 norm is used to perform feature selection, whereas the L2 norm is used to perform feature shrinkage. The Elastic Net Regression model can be represented as follows: L1 norm is used to perform feature selection, whereas the L2 norm is used to perform feature shrinkage.0 To use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection, one should run the model and look at the coefficients of each variable and arbitrarily select the top n features based on the absolute value of the coefficients. After the set of features is selected, the model should be run again with the selected set of features.2"
